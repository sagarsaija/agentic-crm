Modified `frontend/lib/chatApi.ts` to remove LangGraph SDK dependency and call local endpoint directly\n2. Updated `frontend/app/api/agent/route.ts` to properly format SSE responses for assistant-ui\n3. Created troubleshooting guide at `docs/LOCAL_AGENT_SETUP.md`\n\n**Issue found:** User was getting 500 errors because environment variables weren't set up yet.\n\n**Solution:** User needs to create `frontend/.env.local` with:\n- OPENAI_API_KEY (required for AI agent)\n- NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL\n- NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY  \n- SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY\n- TAVILY_API_KEY (optional)\n\n**Next step:** Once user adds env vars and restarts dev server, the chat will work locally at /agents page. All 6 tools (search_leads, get_lead_status, process_lead, get_workflow_status, list_agents, get_crm_stats) are ready to use via natural language.\n\nSee `docs/LOCAL_AGENT_SETUP.md` for complete setup instructions.\n</info added on 2025-10-14T23:24:15.393Z>",
